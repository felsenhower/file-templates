# KDE File Templates

Desktop entries and source files to create new files
(at this point only scripts) according to best practices.

Content goes to `~/.local/share/templates/`.

The files should then appear under "Right click -> Create New" in Dolphin.

The icons have been hand-selected from the choices that are available on 
Manjaro KDE by default. No guarantee that your system will have them.
